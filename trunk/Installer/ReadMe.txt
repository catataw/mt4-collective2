This was built using the Nullsoft Installer at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page

The installer has direct references to where the files are stored on the building PC.  
You can see these by searching for C:\Project.  If you recompile, you will need to 
change these references

License.rtf is the license file that is displayed.  It is changed when the installer is recompiled
